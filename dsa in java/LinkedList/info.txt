ARRAY cannot grow dynamically but LINKED LIST can


ARRAY
1. Arrays are stored in contiguous location.
2. Fixed in size.
3. Memory is allocated at compile time.
4. Uses less memory than linked lists.
5. Elements can be accessed easily.
6. Insertion and deletion operation takes time.

LINKED LISTS
1. Linked lists are not stored in contiguous location.
2. Dynamic in size.
3. Memory is allocated at run time.
4. Uses more memory because it stores both data and the address of next node.
5. Element accessing requires the traversal of whole linked list.
6. Insertion and deletion operation is faster.
