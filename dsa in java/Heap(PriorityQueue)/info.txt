Normal Queue : The way you insert the same way values will be deleted


Priority Queue : you insert the values in random order , value will be removed as per there Priority


HEAP 
---->Priority of parent is always more than children
---->Complete Binary tree 

Complete Binary tree : BT in which every level, except the last level is completely filled, and the last level is filled from left to right

n levels
n-1 levels should be completely filled and nth level should be filled from left-> right


Two cases of pririty-:
a)Smaller Value is having higher priority (eg: ranks) ----> SV Parent node ,lv value child node----Min Heap
b)Larger Value is having higher priority(eg: marks)   ----> LV Parent node ,smaller value child node----Max Heap

Min Heap 
Max Heap
